A js rendered knot forming experiment

## What is a knot
A mathematical knot is an embedding of the circle into three-dimensional Euclidean space. Some common knots are
* unknot

## Why is it interesting?
* It is computationally hard to characterize what kind of a knot it is.
* Our own DNA can be knotted. In fact, there is an enzyme that can open up the knotted DNA and let it form other kind of knots.
* It looks cool!
